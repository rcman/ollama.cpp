This implementation includes:

1. **Parameter Organization**: Parameters are grouped into logical sections using titled borders
2. **Input Types**: Appropriate input components for each data type (text fields, checkboxes)
3. **Start/Stop Functionality**: Buttons to control model execution with state management
4. **Configuration Collection**: Reads all parameters into a Map when starting the model
5. **Logging**: Displays status messages and configuration details
6. **Default Values**: Initializes all fields with their documented defaults
7. **Validation**: Basic number parsing with fallback to string values
8. **Layout**: Scrollable interface with clean organization

Key features:
- All parameters from your specification are included
- Grouped into logical sections (Core, GPU, Threads, RoPE, YaRN, Cache, HuggingFace, Miscellaneous)
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
- Comprehensive logging of all operations
- Disables start button when model is running
- Handles numeric parsing with error fallback

To use the application:
1. Modify any parameters in the form
2. Click "Start Model" to begin with current configuration
3. View configuration in log area
4. Click "Stop Model" when finished
5. Adjust parameters and restart as needed

The GUI is built entirely with standard Java Swing components and requires no external dependencies. All parameters are preserved between start/stop cycles, allowing you to tweak settings and restart the model with new configurations.
