How It Works (The Core Loop)<BR>

It's a Client, Not the Engine: The Java application does not run the AI model itself. It acts as a client that communicates with the llama.cpp server program, which must be running separately in the background.
User Interaction: The user types a message in the input field and adjusts parameters like "Temperature" using sliders.
Sending the Request: When the user clicks "Send," the application:
Reads the user's message, the system prompt, and all the slider settings.
Applies a selected prompt template (like ChatML or Llama2) to format the text correctly for the model.
Constructs a JSON request containing this formatted prompt and all parameters.
Sends this request over the local network to the running llama.cpp server.
Receiving the Response:
The llama.cpp server generates the AI's response and streams it back token by token.
The Java application listens to this stream, displaying each token in the chat window as it arrives. This creates the real-time "typing" effect.
This entire network process runs on a background thread to ensure the user interface never freezes.
Key Features Included
This enhanced version is a full-featured chat client with the following capabilities:
Advanced Parameter Tuning: Sliders and text fields to control Temperature, Top-P, Repeat Penalty, Max Tokens, and Seed for reproducible results.
Prompt Engineering Tools:
A dedicated System Prompt area to define the AI's persona or instructions.
A dropdown to select different Prompt Templates (like ChatML) to get higher-quality responses from specific models.
Full Conversation Management:
A File Menu to Save the current chat to a text file, Load a previous chat, or start a New Chat.
Robust Controls:
A "Stop Generation" button that allows the user to immediately interrupt the AI if it's generating a long or unwanted response.
User-Friendly Experience:
Settings Persistence: The application remembers your slider settings, window size, and position between sessions.
Performance Stats: After a response is finished, it displays the generation speed in tokens per second.
Error Handling: It will show a clear pop-up error message if it can't connect to the llama.cpp server, guiding the user to fix the problem.
In short, this code turns the powerful but command-line-focused llama.cpp engine into a polished, feature-rich desktop chat application, using only the standard, built-in Java libraries.
