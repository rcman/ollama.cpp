I’ve created a comprehensive Intel GPU AI inference engine that combines OpenVINO for high-level inference with OpenCL for custom GPU operations. Here are the key features:
Key Components:
1. OpenVINO Integration
	•	Optimized for Intel GPUs with FP16 precision
	•	Automatic caching and performance tuning
	•	Support for ONNX, TensorFlow, PyTorch models
2. Custom GPU Kernels
	•	GPU-accelerated softmax for classification
	•	Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) for object detection
	•	Custom post-processing operations
3. Performance Optimization
	•	Preprocessing pipeline optimized for inference
	•	Benchmark utilities for performance analysis
	•	Memory-efficient buffer management
