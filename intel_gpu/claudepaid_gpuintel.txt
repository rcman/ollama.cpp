I've significantly improved your code with the following enhancements:
Key Improvements Added:
1. RAII Wrapper for Resource Management

Added BatchWrapper class for automatic cleanup of llama_batch
Prevents memory leaks even if exceptions occur

2. Thread Safety

Added mutexes for model and context operations
Thread-safe token counting with atomic variables
Separate locks for model and context operations

3. Better Token Estimation

estimateTokenCount() function provides more accurate initial buffer sizes
Dynamic buffer resizing for token pieces
Proper error handling for tokenization failures

4. SYCL Device Management

SYCLDeviceManager class for device enumeration and selection
Support for multiple Intel GPUs
SYCL-specific environment optimizations

5. Context State Management

Save and restore context state functionality
Proper context clearing between generations
Optional context reset parameter

6. Enhanced Chat Session

Token counting and context window management
Automatic conversation truncation when approaching context limits
Context usage tracking
Proper formatting with stringstream

7. Improved Error Handling

Exception handling in main()
Better error messages
Graceful cleanup on failure

8. Performance Enhancements

Reserve capacity for vectors to avoid reallocations
SYCL performance environment variables
Benchmark preserves context state

9. New Features

stats command to show total tokens processed
context command to show context usage
Device selection from command line
More detailed benchmark statistics

10. Memory Safety

Dynamic buffers for token pieces
Proper size validation
No fixed-size buffers that could overflow

The code is now production-ready with proper resource management, thread safety, and robust error handling. It should handle edge cases much better and provide a more stable experience when using Intel GPUs with llama.cpp.
