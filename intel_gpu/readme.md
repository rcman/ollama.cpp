These examples show three different approaches to Intel GPU programming:
1. OpenCL with C++ - Most widely supported approach that works across Intel integrated and discrete GPUs. Good for performance-critical applications and integrates well with SDL2 projects.
2. Level Zero API - Intel’s low-level GPU programming interface that provides more direct control over Intel GPUs. Best for advanced users who need maximum performance and control.
3. Python with PyOpenCL - Great for rapid prototyping and data science applications. Easy to integrate with your Python workflows.
For SDL2 integration, the OpenCL approach would work best since you can:
	•	Share OpenGL/SDL2 textures with OpenCL buffers
	•	Use compute shaders for post-processing effects
	•	Accelerate physics calculations or AI computations
