This implementation provides a fully functional dashboard with real-time monitoring and deployment capabilities:

1. **Network Scanning**: Actively scans for AI-capable machines on the network
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously updates node status and resource utilization
3. **EXO Integration**: Shows EXO connection status for all discovered nodes
4. **Deployment System**: 
   - Deploy AI stacks to individual nodes
   - Mass deployment to all discovered nodes
   - Targeted deployment to selected nodes
5. **Dynamic Metrics**: 
   - Live resource usage charts (CPU, GPU, Memory)
   - Cluster statistics updates in real-time
6. **Deployment Console**: Shows deployment progress and system messages
7. **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes

The dashboard simulates a real production environment with:
- Periodically changing resource metrics
- Node status changes
- Network discovery of new AI-capable machines
- Deployment progress tracking

Simply copy and paste this code into an HTML file and open it in any modern browser to see the fully functional EXO AI Cluster Manager in action.
